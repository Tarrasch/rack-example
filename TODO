== A little TODOs list ==

* Add a namespace for all engine's classes
* Make wildcard routes
* Add class autoloading (rails-like)
* Add partial rendering
* Add layout rendering
* Add environments
* Update engine loading procedure (so some classes in diff envs reload on new request)
* We need a name for this little engine
* Add ORM support (AR, Datamapper, Sequel)
